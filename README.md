# Autonomous Wall-Following Vehicle

This project is a real-time autonomous wall-following vehicle developed for a Robotics & Control Systems course (April 2022). Built on a scaled electric vehicle platform, it uses **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and an **Nvidia Jetson Nano** to process sensor data and execute wall-following behavior in both simulation and real-world environments.

## Project Overview

The system leverages Lidar, IMU, and wheel encoders to autonomously navigate while maintaining a fixed distance from a wall. Key features include:

- Real-time control using a tuned PID controller
- Lidar-based wall-following algorithm
- Sensor fusion for accurate localization
- ROS-based software stack for modular control
- Simulated and physical environment testing

## Key Features

- ✅ Real-time wall-following with PID control  
- ✅ Integration of Lidar, IMU, and wheel odometry  
- ✅ ROS-based modular development  
- ✅ Nvidia Jetson Nano for on-board computation  
- ✅ Simulated testing and real-world deployment  

## Technologies & Tools

- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**
- **Nvidia Jetson Nano**
- **Lidar & IMU sensors**
- **C++ / Python**
- **MATLAB** (for motor modeling and simulation)
- **FEMM** (Finite Element Method Magnetics) for PMSM analysis)
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**
